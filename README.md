Bash script to remotely change login screens for MAC OS Catalina.

Important Note: Before proceeding make sure the two things are done:
1) Make sure the "System Integrity Protection" is disabled:

  Go to recovery mode on your Mac OS by rebooting and holding on Command (âŒ˜) and R.
   In recovery on the terminal type "csrutil disable". 
  
2) Make sure the main system disk is 'disk1s5' which is usually the case. If it's different,then change it in file remote_script.sh line 10.

Use this code under your own discretion. I'm in no way responsible if there is any damage or loss of data.
